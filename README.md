SketchResponse
===========

SketchResponse is a Javascript/Python(2.7-3.x) tool for drawing and evaluating
mathematical functions. It was designed for use with the edX online
courseware platform. However, it is a self-contained application that can be
integrated into other web platforms.

Features
--------

- Sketch Tool - configurable Javascript front-end with plugin components to provide different
function drawing and annotation capabilities. See [Sketch-Tool Usage](docs/sketch_tool_usage.md) for a description of the non-configurable interface elements of the sketch tool. See
[Sketch-Tool Plugin Configuration](docs/probconfig_plugins.md) for a description of the available
plugins.
- Grader Library - python back-end that provides an API of function grading methods that
can be composed to construct custom grading scripts. See
[Create a Simple Grading Script](docs/simple_grader.md) for a tutorial on building
a simple grading script.

Installation
------------

* Clone this repository to the directory of your choice:
  * By using HTTPS:

    ```sh
    $ git clone https://github.com/SketchResponse/sketchresponse.git
    ```
  * By using SSH:

    ```sh
    $ git clone git@github.com:SketchResponse/sketchresponse.git
    ```

## Sketch Tool Front-End

### Prerequisites

You'll need to have [Node.js](http://nodejs.org) and npm (which is now packaged with Node) to be installed on your system. *Note: This currently only works with Node version 7.10.1*

### Installation

* Change to the *sketch_tool* directory:

  ```sh
  $ cd sketch_tool
  ```

* Install dependencies listed in *package.json*:

  ```sh
  $ npm install
  ```
  [JSPM](http://jspm.io) will pull in additional dependencies automatically on a post-install script.

* Build a local distribution of the *sketch_tool*:

  ```sh
  $ npm run build
  ```

## Grader Back-End

The SketchResponse grader backend has only two third party package requirements:

* [flask](http://flask.pocoo.org/)
* [numpy](http://www.numpy.org/)

Install them by running the following command in the root directory:

```sh
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Flask is only required if you want to run a local server for convenience when implementing and testing new grading scripts. See the Tutorial [Test a Grading Script on a Local Server](docs/local_test.md) for details.

## Running tests for the Grader Library Back-end

The grader library has a collection of tests to validate the API functions. Those tests can be run from the root directory of the sketchresponse repository with the command below. If you haven't already done so, install the additional packages needed only for the unittest modules.

```sh
$ pip install -r test_requirements.txt
$ python -m unittest discover -t . test_grader_lib/
```

## Rebuilding the documentation

As this project evolves, the current documentation will no longer match the existing codebase. Follow the instructions in [HowTo Build the Docs](docs/howto_build_docs.md) to rebuild as needed.
