SketchResponse
==============

SketchResponse is a Javascript/Python(2.5-2.7) tool for drawing and evaluating
mathematical functions. It was designed for use with the edX online
courseware platform. However, it is a self-contained application that can be
integrated into other web platforms.

## Demo

Before we get into the technical details, try out a [SketchResponse Demo](http://web.mit.edu/~jfrench/www/#demo) to get a sense of what SketchResponse can do.
